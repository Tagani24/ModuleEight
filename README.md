Module Eight Assignment

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I would interpret user needs through user analysis, which would enable me to see exactly how my program is being used and which parts are outpacing other avenues in my program. Creating user stories would help tremendously with my program because it would give me detailed descriptions of what exactly users are experiencing and what changes users would like to see made. User stories to me are the most important tool a company can use when creating a program or building on an already built program and just making it better.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I currently piecemeal my programs when I write them. I break them up into pieces and accomplish each task individually and then put them all together piece by piece, and I have found this method for me personally has worked really well. Because when given a rather long assignment in terms of programing doing everything at once can really be a burden. I plan to use SCRUM moving forward and more specifically sprints, which would allow me to gameplan how I tackle my program. Using sprint has tremendous value and would encourage me rather than deter me. Sprint would allow me to build on my current method and brainstorm which parts are going to take me longer and where my focus should be from part to part.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in a software development environment is something that I one day hope that will come to fruition. I feel like in order to be a good team member you must actually be a team member. Which to me means being there for your team and helping to alleviate any pressures that come from the assignment at hand. There is a saying about being a good team member that has stuck with me for a really long time and it goes "team work, makes the dream work" which I can not agree more with. So being a good team member is being there for your team and offering solutions to problems when you can to make the team's life easier.

Just wanted to say thank you Professor Hodde! I truly learned a lot this course and feel really accomplished with everything I did with this module. The things I learned this module will stay with and hopefully will translate to actual real life scenarios. Thank you again and I wish you the best!!
